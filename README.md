Requirements achieved:

- Responsive design to ensure the website works well on both mobile screens and larger desktops
- Media query used to change thumbnail bar positioning when screen size is larger than 800px
- Alt text attributes applied to images
- Event handler used to switch images based on a click event in the thumbnail bar
- ARIA label added to left and right navigation buttons

Reflections:

- Couldn't figure out what function to call to get the left and right navigation buttons to work
- Couldn't get it so that visually impaired users were able to tab through and select images from the thumbnail bar
- I found this assignment to be a big step up from week 1, even my css styling was tricky (and I needed to use the inspect tool on the example provided). I managed to execute some JavaScript requirements by trial and error but I'm not confident in my ability to write these from memory.

- Q: display:flex should be applied to the parent element, however this didn't seem to work when applying it to the main element. So I've instead applied it to div.thumbnail, but am not 100% sure why this worked. Are the images added in JavaScript considered child elements to the div? The way I'm currently reading it is that the images are the div, as opposed to nested within the div.
